      <para id="id7838769">Weather charts for the different seasons can be recorded e.g. February – summer; May – autumn; August – winter; November – spring. These are not the best months for the seasons but they are the months in which the learners attend school for the whole month. Complete a bar graph for every weather chart so that weather conditions can be compared and discussed. Having completed all the bar graphs these can be compared to one another and the learners can discover weather conditions relevant to their own regions as well as those relevant to each season. The educator can keep the graphs to compare the statistics with the next year’s graphs.</para>

      <para id="id13174868">It is essential to have an initial discussion on the changing of the seasons. Some learners may find it very stimulating to discover what causes seasons and why there are different seasons in the year.</para>
      <para id="id21809450">Learners must complete the pictures by adding their own drawings to illustrate the typical seasonal qualities, e.g.:</para>
      <para id="id7406972">Spring: flowers and blossoms; 2. Summer: anything to do with the seaside or the swimming pool; 3. Autumn: leaves in autumn colours on trees and the ground; 4. Winter: snow on the mountains or rain (where applicable), and leafless trees. Discuss it with the learners.</para>
      <para id="id12459042">Learners are now expected to know the names of the seasons in the correct order, and to write them down. A “year and seasons clock” can be put up in the classroom, which can help the learners to master writing the names.</para>
      <para id="id18573162">Explain the origin of the extra day every 4 years to the learners. Some of the learners may understand it at this stage, but it cannot be expected of them at all.</para>
      <para id="id12994529">This work sheet may elicit a discussion on the Olympic games.</para>
      <para id="id18684102">It is important that the learners must understand that if 1 is added to the 9 units of 99, there is another group of ten. There are now 10 groups of ten altogether, which are grouped together to make 1 group of a hundred.</para>
      <para id="id12055099">Likewise, they must understand that if they want to take away units from a hundred, they first have to dissolve the group of one hundred, and then dissolve 1 group of ten, before they will have units to take away.</para>
      <para id="id5379863">The 0 as place-keeper might cause problems for some learners, Therefore it is essential that the learners must use counters that are grouped in hundreds, tens and units (or the copied blocks), as well as the flared cards, when this work is being done. If necessary, provide similar activities.</para>
      <para id="id18557099">If the learners find it difficult to master place values, lay out the numbers with the flared cards.</para>
      <para id="id21490660">On the next page there is an example of the multiples chart. It can be utilised very effectively, therefore it is suggested that each learner is given a copy.</para>
      <para id="id8566396">This example has been done further than the one on the work sheet, but it can be used for the whole year. Besides, there are learners who are able and keen to count in 6,7,8 and 9.</para>
